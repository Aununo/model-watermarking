%TODO? Tamper-resistance?
%Tamper resistance:  Tamper-detection watermarking was developed to check the authenticity of digital photographs.  Watermarks of  this  type  are  sensitive  to  any change of  the content data;  thus,  by  checking  the integrity  of the  watermark,  the  system  can  determine whether or not the content has the ever been modified or replaced
