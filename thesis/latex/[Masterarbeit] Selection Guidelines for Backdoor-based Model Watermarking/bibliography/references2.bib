abstract = {Object detection performance, as measured on the canonical PASCAL VOC dataset, has
plateaued in the last few years. The best-performing methods are complex ensemble
systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context.
In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves
mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30% relative to the previous best result
on VOC 2012 -- achieving a mAP of 53.3%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1)
one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region
proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data
is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific
fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals
with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also present experiments
that provide insight into what the network learns, revealing a rich hierarchy of image
features. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rbg/rcnn.},
