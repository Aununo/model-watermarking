## Available models

To perform your experiments, you can use our already pre-trained models.
There are three categories of models that you can download:

- [non-watermarked models](non_wm_models.md)
  
Here you can find different CNNs trained on either MNIST, or CIFAR-10.

- [watermarked models](wm_models.md)
  
Here you can find pre-trained models with embedded watermarks.

- [fine-tuned models](fine-tuned_models)
  
Here you can find watermarked models after fine-tuning.
